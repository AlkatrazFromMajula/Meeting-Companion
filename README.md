Consider you're attending a business meeting where all conversations are being captured by an advanced AI application. This application not only transcribes the discussions with high accuracy but also provides a concise summary of the meeting, emphasizing the key points and decisions made.

In this project, I use OpenAI's Whisper to transform speech into text, IBM Watson's AI to summarize and find key points, finally I make an app with Hugging Face Gradio as the user interface.
